# Log in with Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell supports multiple login methods. The simplest way to get started is to log in
interactively at the command line.

## Interactive log in

1. Type `Login-AzureRmAccount`. You will get dialog box asking for your Azure credentials.

2. Type the email address and password associated with your account. Azure authenticates and saves
   the credential information, and then closes the window.

## Log in with a service principal

The recommended approach is to use service principals, which provide a way for you to create
non-interactive accounts that you can use to manipulate resources. Service principals are like user
accounts to which you can apply rules using Azure Active Directory. By granting the minimum
permissions needed to a service principal, you can ensure your automation scripts are even more
secure.

1. If you don't already have a service principal, [create one](create-azure-service-principal-azureps.md).

2. Log in with the service principal.

    ```powershell
    Login-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -ApplicationId  "http://my-app" -Credential $pscredential -TenantId $tenantid
    ```

    To get your TenantId, log in interactively and then get the TenantId from your subscription.

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureRmSubscription
    ```

    ```
    Environment           : AzureCloud
    Account               : username@contoso.com
    TenantId              : XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
    SubscriptionId        : XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
    SubscriptionName      : My Production Subscription
    CurrentStorageAccount :
    ```
