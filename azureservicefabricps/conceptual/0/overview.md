# Azure Service Fabric

Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage
scalable and reliable microservices and addresses the significant challenges in developing and
managing cloud applications. The Service Fabric PowerShell module is installed with the
[Service Fabric SDK, runtime, and tools](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started).
