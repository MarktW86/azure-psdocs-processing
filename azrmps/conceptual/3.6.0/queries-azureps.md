# Querying for Azure resources

## Understanding how queries work in PowerShell

There is no special query language required to query resources using Azure PowerShell. In
PowerShell, cmdlet names take the form of **_Verb-Noun_**. The cmdlets using the verb **_Get_** are
the query cmdlets. The cmdlet nouns are the types of Azure resources that are acted upon by the
cmdlet verbs.

To get a list of Verbs used in the AzureRM module, use the following commands:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module AzureRM  | Select-Object -Unique Verb
```

```
Verb
----
Add
Backup
ConvertTo
Disable
Edit
Enable
Export
Find
Get
Grant
Import
...
```

The previous output is truncated for brevity in this example. As shown in the following example,
there are 40 Verbs used in the AzureRM module.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module AzureRM  | Select-Object -Unique Verb | Measure-Object
```

```
Count    : 40
Average  :
Sum      :
Maximum  :
Minimum  :
Property :
```

The following commands get a list of the 676 Nouns defined in the AzureRM module.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module AzureRM | Select-Object -Unique Noun
```

After reviewing the list of Nouns, you may be interested in seeing what Verbs can be used with Azure VMs. The following examples shows how to get a list of cmdlets that operate on Azure VMs.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module AzureRM -Noun AzureRMVM
```

```
