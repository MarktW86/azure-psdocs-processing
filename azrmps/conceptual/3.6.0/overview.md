# Overview of the Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the Azure Resource Manager model for managing
your Azure resources.

[Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) enables you to work
with the resources in your solution as a group. You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources
for your solution in a single, coordinated operation. You use a template for deployment and that
template can work for different environments such as testing, staging, and production. Resource
Manager provides security, auditing, and tagging features to help you manage your resources after
deployment.

## Install and configure

To use the cmdlets, you need to install and configure Azure PowerShell to connect it to your
account. For more information, see [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](install-azurerm-ps.md).

## Getting started

The Azure PowerShell cmdlets perform most of the same functions available in the Azure portal
interface. You should have a basic working knowledge Azure to be successful using the cmdlets. For
more information about Azure, consult the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/).

You also need a working knowledge PowerShell. To get started with PowerShell, see
[Scripting with PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb978526.aspx).

## Other Resources

If you have deployments that use the classic deployment model that cannot be converted you can
install the Service Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, see
[Install the Azure PowerShell Service Management module](install-azure-ps.md).
